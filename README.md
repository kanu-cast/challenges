# Challenges

### Solutions to coding challenges COA

## Introduction

* This project simply has two files and each file carries an algorithm.
  
## Getting started

## Clone this repository


```
 git clone https://github.com/kanu-cast/challenges.git
```

1. The first file is challengeOne.js which carries the hasSubArray algorithm that checks if an array contains a subArray of numbers that sum up to the target value provided

* To run this function locally open your code editor's terminal and run:

```
node challengeOne.js
```

2. The second file which is challengeTwo.js carries a more complex algorithm called TransformString which basically checks if a string's length is divisible by 3 and returns a reversed version of the string, if the string's length is divisible by 5 it returns the ASCII code of each character in the string and if the string's length is divisible by 3 and 5 it performs both actions on the string respectively.

* To run this function locally open your code editor's terminal and run:

```
node challengeOne.js
```
