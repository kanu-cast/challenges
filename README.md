# Challenges

### Solutions to coding challenges COA

## Introduction

* This project simply has two folders  i.e: algorithms & photo-gallery folders . Please note that each folder contains a separate coding challenge
  
## Getting started

## Clone this repository


```
 git clone https://github.com/kanu-cast/challenges.git
```

# Algorithms Folder

The first folder is algorithms folder that has two files, each file contains a separate algorithm. 

1. The first file is challengeOne.js which carries the hasSubArray algorithm that checks if an array contains a subArray of numbers that sum up to the target value provided

* To run this function locally open your code editor's terminal and run:

```
node challengeOne.js
```

2. The second file which is challengeTwo.js carries a more complex algorithm called TransformString which basically checks if a string's length is divisible by 3 and returns a reversed version of the string, if the string's length is divisible by 5 it returns the ASCII code of each character in the string and if the string's length is divisible by 3 and 5 it performs both actions on the string respectively.

* To run this function locally open your code editor's terminal and run:

```
node challengeOne.js
```

## Introduction

* This project aim at implementing an interactive photo gallery as illustrated in this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/XF6xlvvHBv12WFveDjVoso/COA-Take-home-Challenge?node-id=0-1&t=fw1w2AjG9MySbmet-0)

  
## Getting started
* Open the photo-gallery folder and run gallery.html in any browser of your choice, be sure to hover over the images to get a feel of the amazing animations and hover effects
